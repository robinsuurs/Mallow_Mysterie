  locationFound: Cornelia gave it to you about a year ago after she locked herself
    out three times in a single week.
  description: "A simple small house key. Opens the door to Cornelia\u2019s house.
    She tends to lock herself out quite often when in a rush, but is a bit too paranoid
    to hide a spare key outside, so she decided to just let you keep it."
