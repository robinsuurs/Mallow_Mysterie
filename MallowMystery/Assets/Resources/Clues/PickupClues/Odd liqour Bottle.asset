  description: "A miniature single shot bottle of liquor. Full to the brim with a
    green-colored liquid, that doesn\u2019t look like any liquor you're familiar
    with. Not sealed despite being full. Doesn\u2019t smell like anything. There
    is a particular sigil embossed on the side of the bottle."
