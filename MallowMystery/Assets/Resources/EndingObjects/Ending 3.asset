  - The man in pink forcefully takes the ring off your finger and drags you out by
    the elbow. You get thrown out of the bar and the door slams shut. You wander
    around a bit more, trying to get more information from the passers-by, but eventually
    you're out of options and you drop the investigation. Cornelia's death stays
    a mystery.
  - You get the feeling that if only you did something differently, you wouldn't
    have met this end.
