  - You wander around the area aimlessly for a couple hours, trying to figure out
    where to go. Eventually, you realize you have no idea what you're doing. You
    suddeny understand that you're not a detective, not an investigator. Sadly, you're
    just a regular person.
  - 'You give up.<br> Cornelia''s death stays a mystery. '
