  - As soon as the weird man in pink stops speaking, you notice him gesture somewhere
    to the side. Immediately after a rough-looking man comes out of the shadows,
    grabs you and throws you out of the bar. The door gets slammed shut and you are
    left lying on the ground, bruised and humiliated.
  - Consider yourself lucky. You obviously didn't fool the man in pink at all, and
    he didn't even feel threatened by you in the slightest. There goes this plan.
    At least he spared your life.
  - After this incident, you try and find answers elsewhere, but you keep noticing
    eyes monitoring you from the shadows. Eventually it starts messing with your
    head and you decide to drop the investigation for your own safety. Cornelia's
    death stays a mystery.
  - You get the feeling that if only you did something differently, you wouldn't
    have met this end.
